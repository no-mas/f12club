# F12
A repo to stage my personal website, [f12.club](https://f12.club).

I assure you, this will not be interesting.

## UPDATE: 14 Feb 2025
I am in over my head with regards to git, github, and source control.

I made changes, but I do not understand how to update the repo from
my local directory. I had to do some `rm -r` shenanigans. Oof.
